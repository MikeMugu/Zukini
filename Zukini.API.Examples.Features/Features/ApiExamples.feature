@get_example
Scenario: Get a resource from an API and validate the return data
	Given I perform a GET for post "2"
	Then the Get response should contain the following data
	| userId | id | title        | body                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
	| 1      | 2  | qui est esse | est rerum tempore vitae\nsequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae ea dolores neque\nfugiat blanditiis voluptate porro vel nihil molestiae ut reiciendis\nqui aperiam non debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla |
