=========================

This template is a modified version of the default template that adds the following improvements to it:

- Uses [twitter bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) for a better (a much better!) looking tempalte.
- Uses [prismjs](prismjs.com) for syntax highlighting of features and error messages.
- Adds tree of namespaces to the table of feature summary
- Shows categories in the table of feature summary.
- Highlights the targetted (via hashtag) feature.
